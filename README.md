## Hey all ðŸ‘‹
#### I am Rishat Mukhtarov, an IT-specialist with almost two decades of experience, mostly as a desktop support, a sysadmin and a network engineer.
#### Last two companies I worked for are ACI Worldwide Inc. and Travelline Systems LLC.
#### It is time to stop here, and start a new page in my life - all door are open for becoming a DevOps Engineer.
#### Currently I am learning DevOps things one by one, and some of the most interesting parts share here in GitHub.
